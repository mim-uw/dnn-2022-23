    "# Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement checkpointing for a MLP using NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use the implementation of a MLP and the backpropagation algorithm that you have developed during lab sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway from this task is that with checkpointing we can trade off the computational resources needed to compute the forward pass of the network for the memory requirement needed to perform a backward pass in the network, which is often a major bottleneck when training large networks. In plain english, we can slightly increase the time required for training our network to save some of our GPU's precious memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is checkpointing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of checkpointing is to save every $n$-th layer's (e.g. every 2-nd layer's) forward result (instead of saving every layer's forward result as in plain backpropagation) and use these checkpoints for recomputing the forward pass of the network upon doing a backward pass. Checkpoint layers are kept in memory after the forward pass, while the remaining activations are recomputed at most once. After being recomputed, the non-checkpoint layers are kept in memory until they are no longer required."

    "    a) implementing a method `forward_from_checkpoint` that will recompute the forward pass of the network using one of the checkpointed layers\n",
    "    b) override the method `backprop` to use only checkpointed layers and otherwise compute the activations using `forward_from_checkpoint` method and keep it in memory until no longer needed.\n",
